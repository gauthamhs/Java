Servlets:

They are web pages that are used to add dynamic contents to the server.

Client ------> Servlet(takes requests from the client,  --------> Server
Server -------> Servlet(Takes the response from the server and spits it on the browser) ------------> Client.

Servlets are Java code which serves HTML in them. 
To print HTML Code, 

PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
out.println("<html>");
out.println("Content");
out.println("</html>");

JSP(Java server Page):

JSP's are usually the UI side of the Web application. Servlets acts as the mediator 
and forwards client requests to appropriate JSP pages.

JSP is usually a HTML file where you can put java code using Scriptlets (<%  %>).

JSP will be internally compiled into a servlet when it is run.

<%= %> evaluates the java code.

Context root is the stem of URL.

Example: http://localhost:8080/Deployment/Hello. 
http://localhost:8080 is the domain name. /Deployment is the project. /Hello is the stem URL.

index.jsp - Welcome file.

Summary:

1)Servlet: HTML in Java.
JSP: Java in HTML

2) Both create dynamic content.

3) Servlet acts as Controller and JSP acts as view.

4) Servlet harder to code compared to JSP.

5) JSP internally converted to servlet.

6) Servlet is faster than JSP.

7) JSP has custom tags that can directly call Java Beans.
