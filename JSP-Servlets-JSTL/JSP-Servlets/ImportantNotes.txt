WAR Files:

WAR Files are web archive files where you can archive your entire JSP Servlet Web application into a file and can be 
deployed onto a server(either local or Tomcat). You can create a WAR file by exporting your project as a WAR file.
To deploy your web applications, you could put the WAR files in Apache Tomcat Folder under the libs directory.

Servlet Mapping:

If you have a context servlet root Login and would like to change to some other name, you could change the servlet mapping 
in Web.xml File.
